# 0010 — Flyway for database schema migrations

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-20

## Context

The worker booted with `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto: create`, so Hibernate **dropped and recreated
the whole schema on every start**. Convenient for a throwaway demo, but this template aims to be
production-shaped ([ADR-0008](0008-track-the-latest-major-versions.md),
[ADR-0009](0009-actuator-probes-and-prometheus-metrics.md)), and a fork can't go to production that
way: no history of how the schema evolved, no reviewable diff for a column change, and every restart
destroys the data. Production needs schema changes that are **versioned, reviewable in a PR,
repeatable, and non-destructive**.

Because the engine is **remote**, the two schemas live in **separate databases**: the worker's
application tables (`leasing_application`, `bike_portfolio`) in `bikeleasing_app`, and the Operaton
engine's `ACT_*` tables in `bikeleasing_engine`, owned by the `engine-service` host (which manages its
own schema via the engine's `schema-update`). A migration tool in the worker therefore owns **only** the
worker's application tables — it never touches the engine's schema, which lives in another database and
another app.

## Decision

We use **[Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/)** as the owner of the worker's application schema and switch
Hibernate to **`ddl-auto: validate`** — Hibernate now only checks that the mapped entities match the
migrated schema and never creates or drops a table.

- **Dependencies** (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`, `database` bundle):
  **`spring-boot-starter-flyway`** + `flyway-database-postgresql`. The starter is required, not raw
  `flyway-core`: Spring Boot 4 modularised the Flyway autoconfiguration out of
  `spring-boot-autoconfigure`, so `flyway-core` alone puts Flyway on the classpath but never wires it
  to the datasource (migrations silently don't run). Postgres additionally needs the separate
  `flyway-database-postgresql` module. Versions come from the Spring Boot BOM.
- **Migrations** live in `service/example-service/src/main/resources/db/migration/`, named
  `V{n}__description.sql`, **forward-only** (an applied migration is checksummed and never edited — fix
  it with a new one). Flyway applies pending migrations on start-up, before Hibernate validates, and
  records each in its `flyway_schema_history` table. The baseline `V1__init.sql` reproduces the two
  current entities.
- **Seed vs. schema split:** Flyway owns **schema only**. The bike catalogue stays in an idempotent
  `ApplicationRunner` seeder, because that data — especially the out-of-stock demo entry — is a
  **demo/test fixture, not production reference data**, and must not be baked into a fork's real
  database.
- **Tests keep Flyway off.** The `test` profile runs on in-memory H2 with Hibernate building the
  schema; `spring.flyway.enabled: false` in `application-test.yaml` stops the Postgres-flavoured
  baseline from running against H2. The migrations are therefore exercised by the real-Postgres paths —
  local `bootRun` and the Bruno CI jobs.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** schema changes are versioned SQL, reviewed in the PR that needs them, and applied
  repeatably to any environment; data survives restarts; a fork is production-shaped from day one.
- **Negative / trade-offs:** a schema change is now two coordinated edits (the entity **and** a new
  `V{n}__…sql`); a dev DB previously built by `ddl-auto: create` has no `flyway_schema_history`, so it
  must be dropped once when adopting Flyway (`docker compose … down -v`).
- **Neutral:** real reference data, if it ever appears, would move into a Flyway **repeatable**
  migration (`R__…sql`) rather than the seeder. Verifying migrations against real Postgres in the unit
  suite (a Testcontainers `@DataJpaTest`) is the documented upgrade path — deferred because no
  Testcontainers infrastructure exists yet.
