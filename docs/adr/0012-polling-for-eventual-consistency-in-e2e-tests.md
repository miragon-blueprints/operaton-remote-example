# 0012 — Poll for eventual consistency in end-to-end tests

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-21

## Context

Every command endpoint in the worker's API is **asynchronous**. A command controller hands a message
or a task-completion to the remote Operaton engine through the generated `/engine-rest` client and
returns **`202 Accepted`** immediately — it waits for the engine to accept the correlation, not for the
process to advance. The observable effect lands some unbounded time later: the process reaches its next
wait state, an **external-task worker** (`adapter/inbound/operaton`) picks up the topic, runs, and
writes the read model (`leasing_application`). The gap between "the command returned" and "its effect is
visible" is real, and it is **environment-dependent** — a loaded CI runner is slower than a laptop.

The Bruno end-to-end suite (`bruno/`) originally bridged that gap with **fixed sleeps** — hand-tuned
`setTimeout`s from 1.5 s to a 40 s wait for the incident-retry window. That is the classic flaky-test
anti-pattern: a sleep tuned to pass locally loses the race under CI load (the `07-inbox-empty` scenario
did exactly this), while the safe-side sleeps waste minutes on every run. The same async shape is
inherent to **every process blueprint** in this family, so the fix has to be a reusable pattern, not a
per-test number.

## Decision

We assert eventual state by **polling until the real condition holds, capped by a generous timeout** —
never by sleeping a guessed duration.

- **Shared helpers** live in `bruno/collection.bru` (a collection-level `script:pre-request`, so they
  are in scope for every request): `pollUntil(config, predicate, opts)` and the convenience wrappers
  `pollApp(path, predicate)` (GET the worker read model) and `pollEngine(path, predicate)` (GET a
  Operaton `/engine-rest` query — process instances, jobs, tasks, incidents, history). They return
  the instant the predicate is met and only wait the full budget when something is genuinely wrong — at
  which point the request's own assertions report the real, still-wrong state instead of a bare timeout.
- **Budgets are env-driven** (`pollTimeoutMs` / `pollIntervalMs` in the environment file), so a sibling
  blueprint with different propagation characteristics tunes them **once**, in one place. A scenario
  that needs a wider window (the incident-retry demo, whose external task retries 3× 10 s apart before
  the engine raises the incident) passes `{ timeoutMs }` at the call site.
- **Each scenario polls for its own precondition or assertion**, mirroring the read model's observable
  fields — the `status` enum (`RECEIVED → ORDERED → HANDED_OVER → ACTIVE`, plus `WITHDRAWN`,
  `REJECTED`, `CANCELLED`) and worker-set fields (`contractId`, `orderId`). Command steps gate on the
  precondition that makes the command valid: `contractId != null` before `sign-contract` (the
  `sendContract` worker issues the contract before the process parks on the signature wait state);
  `status == "ORDERED" && orderId != null` before `report-handover` and `withdraw` (the bike order has
  been placed and can be compensated); the inbox (`/api/tasks/clarify-alternative`) listing the item
  before completing the `clarify-alternative` user task.
- **Division of labour holds:** Bruno asserts the **synchronous request/response contract** (status
  codes, DTO shape); genuinely engine-level, deterministic checks (timer fast-forward via
  `/engine-rest/job/{id}/execute`, full token flow) stay in the JVM `@CamundaSpringProcessTest` layer.
  See ADR-0004 for the test layering.
- **The Bruno CLI is pinned** (`@usebruno/cli@4.0.0`): the script sandbox's capabilities (available
  globals, the `require` whitelist the helpers depend on) can change between majors, so an unpinned
  `latest` is a correctness risk, not just a supply-chain one.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** the suite is robust under CI load and *faster* in the common case — it waits exactly as
  long as the engine needs, turning the 40 s incident sleep into "as soon as the incident appears".
  One env-tunable budget replaces the magic numbers, and the pattern ports to every sibling blueprint.
- **Negative / trade-offs:** each polled step issues an extra read before the "official" request; a
  predicate must be kept honest (it should mirror what the request asserts, or it silently waits out the
  whole budget). Two read-model writes — `report-handover` and `withdraw` — set their status
  (`HANDED_OVER` / `WITHDRAWN`) *unconditionally* in the worker, independent of message correlation, so
  tests assert the **downstream** worker-driven state (`ACTIVE`, `CANCELLED`) as proof the process
  actually advanced, not those intermediate flips.
- **Neutral:** the "submit → poll an observable status" shape becomes the documented client contract for
  these async APIs, for real consumers as much as for tests.

## Implementation notes

- The Bruno script sandbox exposes **no global `fetch`**; `require('axios')` works and is what the
  helpers use. Helpers are attached to `globalThis` in the collection script so request-level scripts
  can call them.
- Message commands correlate by business key (the `applicationId`); an early publish is buffered by the
  engine's message subscription, so gating on the read-model precondition (rather than exact timing) is
  sufficient. `clarify-alternative` completes a user task and would fail if the task is not yet
  searchable, hence gating on the inbox.
- **Deferred, not adopted:** a test-only endpoint exposing engine progress deterministically would be
  the strongest guarantee, but it leaks engine internals into the API surface for test convenience.
  Revisit only if predicate-based polling proves insufficient.
